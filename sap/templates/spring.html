<h3>Dependency Injection (DI) Strategies in SAP Hybris</h3>
<p>In SAP Hybris, <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong> is a core design principle that allows objects to be
    injected with their dependencies rather than creating them directly. This promotes loose coupling, modular design,
    and easier testability. DI in Hybris typically leverages the Spring Framework, which is fully integrated into the
    platform.</p>
<p>There are several strategies or techniques to manage DI in Hybris, including constructor injection, setter injection,
    and field injection. Let&#39;s explore these strategies in detail:</p>
<hr>
<h3>1. <strong>Constructor Injection</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Constructor Injection</strong> is the most preferred and recommended strategy in Hybris for injecting
    dependencies. It ensures that the object’s dependencies are available immediately upon instantiation and are
    provided in a controlled, immutable way.</p>
<h4>How it works:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Dependencies are passed to the constructor when an instance of a class is created.</li>
    <li>Spring injects the dependencies automatically through the constructor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
public class MyService {

    private final ProductService productService;

    // Constructor Injection
    @Autowired
    public MyService(ProductService productService) {
        this.productService = productService;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        productService.executeAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, and they cannot be
        changed later.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Easier to Test</strong>: Constructor injection makes testing easier because all dependencies are
        explicitly passed and can be mocked.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: It is clear what dependencies are required for a class to function correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When all dependencies are mandatory for the class to function.</li>
    <li>When you want to ensure immutability and thread safety.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>2. <strong>Setter Injection</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Setter Injection</strong> is another common DI strategy where dependencies are injected via setter methods,
    allowing more flexibility in configuration, but at the cost of potentially creating mutable objects.</p>
<h4>How it works:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Dependencies are injected via public setter methods after the class is instantiated.</li>
    <li>Spring calls the setter methods and passes the dependencies at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
public class MyService {

    private ProductService productService;

    // Setter Injection
    @Autowired
    public void setProductService(ProductService productService) {
        this.productService = productService;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        productService.executeAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Dependencies can be injected or changed after the object is created.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Dependencies</strong>: It&#39;s easier to manage optional dependencies, as setters can be used
        for non-required properties.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When dependencies are optional.</li>
    <li>When you need more flexibility in configuring dependencies after object creation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>3. <strong>Field Injection</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Field Injection</strong> is the most direct and least explicit form of DI. Dependencies are injected directly
    into the fields of a class, bypassing the constructor or setter methods. It relies on the <code>@Autowired</code>
    annotation directly on the field.</p>
<h4>How it works:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Spring injects the dependency directly into the field without the need for constructor or setter methods.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;

    public void performAction() {
        productService.executeAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Minimal boilerplate code is needed. It&#39;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick Setup</strong>: For small projects or simple components, field injection can be fast and
        convenient.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Visibility</strong>: It’s not immediately clear which dependencies a class needs, as they are
        not explicitly passed through the constructor or setter methods.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Testing Issues</strong>: Testing can become more difficult because dependencies cannot be easily mocked
        or controlled. Field injection makes it harder to make the class immutable or ensure that all dependencies are
        set correctly.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>For quick-and-dirty prototypes or tests.</li>
    <li>When dependencies are injected directly into specific service classes that don’t need to be immutable.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>4. <strong>Autowiring by Type and Name</strong></h3>
<p>In Spring DI, you can use the <code>@Autowired</code> annotation to autowire beans by type or by name. By default,
    Spring performs autowiring by type, but you can also autowire beans by name to resolve multiple beans of the same
    type.</p>
<h4>Autowiring by Type (Default):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Spring injects the dependency based on the type of the field or constructor parameter.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Autowiring by Name:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can specify the bean name to be injected by using the <code>@Qualifier</code> annotation.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Autowired
@Qualifier(&quot;productServiceBean&quot;)
private ProductService productService;
</code></pre>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Autowiring by type is most common.</li>
    <li>Autowiring by name is useful when multiple beans of the same type exist in the Spring container and you need to
        specify which one should be injected.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>5. <strong>Lazy Initialization</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Lazy Initialization</strong> is a strategy where dependencies are only instantiated when they are first
    required, instead of being initialized at startup. This can be useful for optimizing startup time and memory usage,
    particularly in cases where certain dependencies are rarely used.</p>
<h4>How it works:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Dependencies are injected lazily using <code>@Lazy</code> annotation.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Autowired
@Lazy
private ProductService productService;
</code></pre>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When certain dependencies are rarely used and you want to delay their creation for performance reasons.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>6. <strong>Qualifier Annotation</strong></h3>
<p>When you have multiple beans of the same type, you can specify which bean should be injected using the <code>@Qualifier</code>
    annotation in conjunction with <code>@Autowired</code>.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier(&quot;specialProductService&quot;)
    private ProductService productService;

    public void performAction() {
        productService.executeAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When you have multiple beans of the same type and you need to distinguish between them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>7. <strong>Primary Bean</strong></h3>
<p>In case of multiple beans of the same type, you can mark one of the beans as primary using the <code>@Primary</code>
    annotation. The <code>@Autowired</code> annotation will then inject this primary bean when no
    <code>@Qualifier</code> is specified.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Bean
@Primary
public ProductService productService() {
    return new ProductServiceImpl();
}
</code></pre>
<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When one of the beans of the same type is considered the default and should be injected when no explicit
        qualification is given.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Constructor Injection</strong> is the preferred DI strategy as it ensures that all required dependencies
        are provided at the time of object creation and enforces immutability.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Setter Injection</strong> provides flexibility for optional dependencies but can lead to mutable
        objects.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Field Injection</strong> is the simplest but least explicit and can lead to poor testability and
        maintainability.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Autowiring</strong> strategies (by type, name, and qualifiers) allow for better control and flexibility
        when working with multiple beans of the same type.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lazy Initialization</strong> helps with performance optimization by delaying the instantiation of
        certain dependencies.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the right DI strategy depends on the requirements of your class, such as whether dependencies are mandatory,
    optional, or changeable after instantiation. Generally, constructor injection is favored for most scenarios, while
    setter and field injection are used when flexibility or simplicity is needed.</p>
<p>In the context of Spring and SAP Hybris, the <code>@Required</code> annotation is a part of Spring&#39;s <strong>dependency
    injection</strong> mechanism and is used to indicate that a bean property must be set during the bean initialization
    phase. This annotation is typically used for <strong>setter injection</strong>. When a bean is being created by the
    Spring container, Spring will check whether the required property (annotated with <code>@Required</code>) is set,
    and if not, it will throw an exception during the bean&#39;s initialization phase.</p>
<h3>Key Points of <code>@Required</code> Annotation:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Setter Injection</strong>:<br>The <code>@Required</code> annotation is typically used on <strong>setter
        methods</strong> to indicate that the property is mandatory and must be injected by Spring.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Validation at Initialization</strong>:<br>When Spring initializes the bean, it checks whether the
        required property is set. If it isn&#39;t, an exception (<code>BeanInitializationException</code>) will be
        thrown, indicating that the required dependency is missing.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Dependency Injection Context</strong>:<br>The <code>@Required</code> annotation works in the context
        of <strong>autowiring</strong> and dependency injection within the Spring container. It helps ensure that all
        necessary properties are set before the bean is used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Usage</strong>:<br>It can be placed on a <strong>setter method</strong> in a Spring-managed bean.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
public class ProductService {

    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    // Setter method with @Required annotation
    @Required
    public void setProductRepository(ProductRepository productRepository) {
        this.productRepository = productRepository;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        productRepository.executeAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, if the <code>ProductRepository</code> bean is not provided by the Spring container during
    initialization, Spring will throw an exception because <code>@Required</code> indicates that the <code>productRepository</code>
    dependency must be injected.</p>
<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Spring 3 and Later</strong>:<br>The <code>@Required</code> annotation was commonly used in earlier
        versions of Spring to indicate mandatory dependencies. However, in modern versions of Spring (Spring 4 and
        later), the use of <code>@Autowired</code> (which can handle required properties) has largely replaced <code>@Required</code>
        for dependency injection.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Considerations for Usage</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Dependency Injection</strong>: If you use <code>@Autowired</code>, Spring will
                automatically inject the required dependency, and you don&#39;t necessarily need <code>@Required</code>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Optional Dependencies</strong>: If a dependency is optional, you should either use setter
                injection without <code>@Required</code> or handle it programmatically within your application code.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Spring 5 and Beyond</strong>:<br>In newer versions of Spring, it&#39;s generally recommended to rely
        on constructor injection with <code>@Autowired</code> (which makes dependencies mandatory by default) rather
        than using <code>@Required</code>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>When to Use <code>@Required</code>:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Legacy Code</strong>: If you&#39;re working with legacy Spring code that uses <code>@Required</code> and
        setter-based dependency injection.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Explicit Mandatory Properties</strong>: When you need to enforce that a certain setter method must be
        called with a valid bean during initialization.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>@Required</code></strong> is used to mark setter methods as mandatory for dependency injection.
    </li>
    <li>It is part of <strong>setter injection</strong> and helps ensure that required dependencies are provided before
        the bean is used.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Spring 4+</strong> prefers constructor injection with <code>@Autowired</code> for better clarity and
        immutability, making the usage of <code>@Required</code> less common.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>In Spring, beans can be defined with different scopes, primarily <strong>Singleton</strong> and
    <strong>Prototype</strong>, which dictate the lifecycle and instance management of beans. <strong>Singleton</strong>
    scope ensures a single shared instance across the application context, while <strong>Prototype</strong> scope
    creates a new instance each time the bean is requested. This difference significantly impacts memory management,
    performance, and state management in Spring-based applications.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Bean Scopes in Spring: Singleton vs Prototype</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Singleton Scope</strong>:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: A <strong>singleton</strong> scoped bean means that the Spring container will
        create <strong>only one instance</strong> of the bean for the entire Spring container (i.e., the application
        context). This instance is shared across the application for every request.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Lifecycle</strong>: A single instance is created when the Spring context is initialized (during the
        application startup), and it is destroyed when the Spring context is destroyed (application shutdown).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Use Case</strong>: Singleton beans are ideal for <strong>stateless services</strong> or when an
        instance should be reused throughout the application&#39;s lifecycle (e.g., database connections, service layer
        components).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">@Component
@Scope(&quot;singleton&quot;)
public class MySingletonBean {
    // This bean will be created once and shared across the whole application context.
}
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Behavior</strong>: The same instance of the bean will be injected into all dependent classes. This
        can be beneficial for performance but should be avoided if the bean holds state-specific data that should not be
        shared across requests or threads.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Prototype Scope</strong>:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: A <strong>prototype</strong> scoped bean means that a <strong>new
        instance</strong> of the bean is created each time it is requested from the Spring container.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Lifecycle</strong>: The bean&#39;s lifecycle is managed by the container only for its creation. After
        the bean is instantiated, the container does not manage its destruction. The bean is typically destroyed when it
        is no longer referenced, and you would need to manage its destruction manually if needed (using <code>@PreDestroy</code>
        or implementing <code>DisposableBean</code>).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Use Case</strong>: Prototype beans are useful for <strong>stateful beans</strong> where each instance
        needs to be independent of others (e.g., user sessions, transient stateful services).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">@Component
@Scope(&quot;prototype&quot;)
public class MyPrototypeBean {
    // A new instance will be created every time this bean is requested.
}
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Behavior</strong>: Each request for the bean results in a fresh instance. This is useful in cases
        where the bean holds state or other properties that should not be shared across different components or threads.
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3><strong>Usage Considerations</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Singleton Scope</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use when the object is stateless, or the state is shared across all instances of the application (e.g.,
                caching services, configuration managers).
            </li>
            <li>Spring automatically handles the lifecycle and cleanup.</li>
            <li>Avoid in multi-threaded contexts when the bean holds state that could conflict between different threads
                or requests.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Prototype Scope</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use when you need a <strong>unique</strong> instance per request, typically for <strong>stateful
                beans</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>The container does not manage the destruction of prototype beans, so you need to manage them manually if
                necessary (e.g., resource cleanup).
            </li>
            <li>Be cautious of <strong>memory overhead</strong> due to frequent instantiation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Example of Usage</strong>:</h3>
<h4>Singleton Bean:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
@Scope(&quot;singleton&quot;)
public class DatabaseService {
    public DatabaseService() {
        System.out.println(&quot;DatabaseService instance created&quot;);
    }

    public void connect() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Connecting to the database...&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Prototype Bean:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Component
@Scope(&quot;prototype&quot;)
public class UserSession {
    public UserSession() {
        System.out.println(&quot;New UserSession instance created&quot;);
    }

    public void startSession() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Starting a new session...&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Requesting Singleton Bean</strong>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">@Autowired
private DatabaseService databaseService1;

@Autowired
private DatabaseService databaseService2;

// databaseService1 and databaseService2 will refer to the same instance.
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Requesting Prototype Bean</strong>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">@Autowired
private UserSession userSession1;

@Autowired
private UserSession userSession2;

// userSession1 and userSession2 will refer to different instances.
</code></pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Summary</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Singleton scope</strong> is used when a single shared instance is needed, reducing memory usage and
        overhead, making it suitable for stateless services and shared resources.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prototype scope</strong> creates a new instance each time, making it ideal for stateful objects that
        require fresh instances for every request, but it comes with the overhead of creating multiple instances.
    </li>
</ul>
