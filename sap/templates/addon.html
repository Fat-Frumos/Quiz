    <p>AddOns in SAP Commerce are a powerful mechanism for extending and customizing Hybris without impacting the core
        functionality. They offer a modular, flexible, and upgrade-safe way to add new features and integrate
        third-party systems into the platform. By using AddOns, businesses can build a tailored e-commerce experience
        while maintaining the integrity and maintainability of the SAP Commerce solution.</p></div>
<p>
    - Built on top of the existing SAP Hybris Commerce
    to extend the functionality of the SAP Hybris
    Commerce Accelerator.
</p>
<p>
    - Addons are a form of extension that allows you to
    add front-end files e.g. JSP, CSS, and JS via your
    AddOn. (May or may not include frontend )
</p>
<p>
    - No editing in core code of SAP Hybris (This is
    considered as best practice)
</p>
<p>
    - Adhere to best practices in SAP Hybris development.
</p>
<p>
    - Safely upgrade your core SAP Hybris code without the need for excessive development.
</p>
<p>
    - You can add and remove the AddOn, whenever needed without refactoring or otherwise rewriting code.

</p>
<p>In SAP Commerce (Hybris), an <strong>AddOn</strong> is a type of extension that allows developers to add new
    functionalities to an existing storefront (or other parts of the SAP Commerce application) without directly
    modifying the core code or the original extension code. AddOns are typically used to extend the default
    functionality of the Hybris platform, specifically in storefronts built on Accelerators, such as adding new
    features or customizing the storefront’s user interface.</p>
<p>An AddOn is a modular piece of code that can be injected into a Hybris solution without altering the base
    system's code. This provides flexibility in adding new features to the platform without disturbing the integrity
    of the original system, allowing you to customize and extend the behavior of the Hybris application easily.</p>
<h3>Structure of AddOns</h3>
<p>AddOns are usually packaged as separate extensions that follow specific guidelines for integration into the
    existing Hybris platform. The typical structure of an AddOn includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend code</strong>: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the storefront.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend logic</strong>: Java classes or services that interact with the Hybris service layer,
        possibly modifying behavior or adding new functionality.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integration hooks</strong>: These hooks are points where the AddOn integrates with the storefront or
        other modules.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Resources</strong>: Configuration files, templates, or other assets that the AddOn uses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How AddOns Work</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Modular Extension</strong>: An AddOn is installed as an extension but does not require modifying the
        core or any other extension code directly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integration with Accelerators</strong>: AddOns are commonly used with Hybris Accelerators to inject
        custom behavior into a storefront. For example, you could create an AddOn to add a payment gateway to an
        accelerator-based storefront.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Seamless Upgrades</strong>: Since AddOns don’t modify core files or logic, they are usually
        upgrade-safe. You can update or upgrade Hybris without worrying about breaking customizations made through
        AddOns.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Behavior</strong>: The AddOn might include components, services, or even front-end resources
        that are dynamically injected into the application depending on the business needs.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Example Use Cases for AddOns</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Payment Gateway Integration</strong>: You can create an AddOn to integrate a custom payment gateway
        without modifying core Hybris components.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Custom Search</strong>: An AddOn can be used to integrate a custom search solution (like
        Elasticsearch or a specific recommendation engine) into the storefront.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Custom Widgets</strong>: AddOns can add new widgets to the storefront that provide extra
        functionality, such as banners, promotional modules, or custom product recommendations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Integrations</strong>: AddOns are ideal for integrating external systems like CRM, ERP,
        or other marketing tools without altering Hybris’s core functionality.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Advantages of Using AddOns</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>AddOns help keep your core Hybris system code clean and maintainable by isolating custom
                functionality into modular extensions. This makes it easier to manage and maintain your custom
                features.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>You can add new features or change existing functionality on the fly without modifying the core
                codebase. This means you can customize your SAP Commerce environment to meet specific business needs
                without touching the base platform’s code.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade Compatibility</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Since AddOns do not alter the core code, they tend to be more upgrade-safe. When you upgrade SAP
                Commerce, your custom AddOns are less likely to break, provided they follow good coding practices.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Modular Development</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>AddOns can be developed and tested independently, making them easier to deploy and scale. This
                modularity allows for focused development, which can result in faster time to market for new
                features or integrations.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Risk</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>By using AddOns, you avoid directly modifying the core extensions or platform logic, which can
                reduce the risk of introducing bugs or incompatibilities with future Hybris upgrades.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reusability</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>AddOns can be reused across different Hybris projects or environments. For example, you can create
                an AddOn that handles a specific payment method and reuse it across different stores or instances of
                SAP Commerce.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Customizable and Extensible</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>AddOns can be customized and extended to meet specific business requirements. This allows businesses
                to implement unique features without being constrained by the out-of-the-box functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Example of an AddOn Creation</h3>
<p>To create an AddOn in SAP Commerce, you typically:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Define your AddOn in the Hybris <code>localextensions.xml</code>.</li>
    <li>Develop the AddOn by following the structure required for Hybris extensions (such as adding services,
        controllers, and frontend resources).
    </li>
    <li>Include necessary templates, configuration, and resource files to integrate your AddOn into the storefront
        or back-office.
    </li>
</ol>
