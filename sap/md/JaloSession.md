### Role of JaloSession

1. **Thread-local Variable**:
   - Each thread in Hybris has its own instance of `JaloSession`, ensuring that session data is isolated per thread.
   - This instance is created when the session is first accessed, allowing for thread-safe operations.

2. **Non-persistent Yet Serializable**:
   - While `JaloSession` is not persistent in the database, it can be serialized. This means that it can be stored in memory and sent over the network, which is essential for web applications.
   - This serialization allows the session data to be transferred across different components of the application as needed.

3. **Session-specific Information**:
   - `JaloSession` holds crucial session-related information, including:
     - **User Details**: Information about the currently logged-in user.
     - **Currency**: The currency used for transactions and display purposes.
     - **Language**: The language preference for the session, which affects localization of the content.
     - **Time Zone**: The time zone setting for the session, which is important for date and time operations.

4. **Subtype Creation via Spring Bean**:
   - A subtype of `JaloSession` can be created via a Spring bean configuration named `jalosession`.
   - In most applications, developers work with the `CommerceJaloSession` rather than the base `JaloSession`, which provides additional functionality specific to commerce-related operations.

5. **Lifecycle with HTTP Session**:
   - When `JaloSession` is contained within an HTTP session, its lifecycle is tied to that of the HTTP session. 
   - If the HTTP session expires or is invalidated, the `JaloSession` is also terminated.
   - The default timeout for a session can be configured (e.g., `default.session.timeout=3600` for a one-hour timeout).

6. **Partially Wrapped by SessionService**:
   - While `JaloSession` provides low-level access to session data, the `SessionService` offers a higher-level API for managing session interactions.
   - This abstraction makes it easier for developers to work with session data without dealing directly with the complexities of `JaloSession`.

7. **Access from Various Services**:
   - `JaloSession` is accessed from various services in Hybris, enabling components to retrieve session-specific information as needed. 
   - For example, you might access user preferences or localization settings directly from a service method.

### Example of Using JaloSession

To illustrate how `JaloSession` can be accessed and used in Hybris, consider the following code snippet:

```java
import de.hybris.platform.jalo.JaloSession;

// Retrieve the current JaloSession
JaloSession jaloSession = JaloSession.getCurrentSession();

// Get user information from the session
String userId = jaloSession.getUser().getUid();
String currency = jaloSession.getCurrency().getIsocode();
String language = jaloSession.getLanguage().getIsocode();
```
